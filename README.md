## About the project
This project uses python to create a simple simulation of Newtonian gravity between planets.

### Created Using:
 * Python (including the numpy and tkinter libraries)

In order to run the simulation, both numpy and tkinter must be installed. 

The simulation runs automatically, and can be restarted by pressing the space bar. To toggle the quadtree visualization, click the screen.
